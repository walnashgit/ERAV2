# How to build a DNN

### In this folder we have a 4 step approach to building a DNN. We will start with basic approach like setup, skeletal model and gradually improve the model. Our target is 99.4% test accuracy with less than 8k param and in under 15 EPOCHS.

## Models

1. [Model1](https://github.com/walnashgit/ERAV2/tree/main/S7/model1)
2. [Model2](https://github.com/walnashgit/ERAV2/tree/main/S7/model2)
3. [Model3](https://github.com/walnashgit/ERAV2/tree/main/S7/model3)
4. [Model4](https://github.com/walnashgit/ERAV2/tree/main/S7/model4)
